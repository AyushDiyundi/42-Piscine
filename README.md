# 🏊‍♂️ 42 Piscine - July 2025

Welcome to my **42 Piscine** repository! This repo contains all of my solutions, projects, and exercises completed during the Piscine at [42 Network](https://42.fr). The Piscine is a month-long intensive bootcamp focused on mastering the C programming language, Unix systems, and software development fundamentals under pressure.

## 📚 Contents

Each folder includes assignments ranging from basic syntax and logic to more advanced memory management, data structures, and team collaboration.

## 🤝 Peer-to-Peer Learning

One of the most unique and rewarding aspects of the 42 experience is its **peer-to-peer learning model**. There are no traditional teachers — instead, students learn by doing, debugging, collaborating, and **correcting each other's code**.

You’re not alone in the Piscine — you're surrounded by fellow learners all working hard, solving problems, and pushing their limits. It's not just about coding — it's about **learning how to learn**, **teaching others**, and growing together.

## 🧠 Key Skills Practiced

- C language fundamentals (loops, conditionals, arrays, pointers, structs)
- Memory management and debugging
- Recursion and algorithmic thinking
- Shell scripting & command-line tools
- Teamwork and code review
- Code style compliance with [42 Norme](https://github.com/42School/norminette)

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run any C program in the project:
1. Navigate to the exercise folder:
   ```bash
   cd C01/ex00
2. Compile with gcc:
   gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror *.c -o program
3. RUN:
   ./program or a.out

🛠 Note: All code is written in standard C99 and tested on macOS/Linux with GCC.

📌 Disclaimer
This code reflects my personal solutions during the Piscine. It is shared here for educational purposes only. If you're a current or future Pisciner, try to solve the exercises on your own before referring to others' solutions.
